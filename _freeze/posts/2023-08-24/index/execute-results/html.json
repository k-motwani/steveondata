Sanderson II, MPH\"\ndate: \"2023-08-24\"\ncategories: [rtip, viz]\n---\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nGraphs are powerful visual tools for analyzing and presenting data. In this blog post, we will explore how to plot multiple lines on a graph using base R. We will cover two methods: `matplot()` and `lines()`. These functions provide flexibility and control over the appearance of the lines, allowing you to create informative and visually appealing plots. So, let's dive in and learn how to plot multiple lines on a graph in R!\n\n# Examples\n\n## Example 1 Using `matplot()`:\n\nThe `matplot()` function is a convenient way to plot multiple lines in one chart when you have a dataset in a wide format. Here's an example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create sample data\nx <- 1:10\ny1 <- c(1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 10, 2)\ny2 <- c(2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 10, 3, 1)\ny3 <- c(3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 2, 4, 1)\n\n# Plot multiple lines using matplot\nmatplot(x, cbind(y1, y2, y3), type = \"l\", lty = 1, \n        col = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"), xlab = \"X\", \n        ylab = \"Y\", main = \"Multiple Lines Plot\")\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", \"Line 3\"), \n       col = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"), \n       lty = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- We first create sample data for the x-axis (`x`) and three lines (`y1`, `y2`, `y3`).\n- The `matplot()` function is then used to plot the lines. We pass the x-axis values (`x`) and a matrix of y-axis values (`cbind(y1, y2, y3)`) as input.\n- The `type = \"l\"` argument specifies that we want to plot lines.\n- The `lty = 1` argument sets the line type to solid.\n- The `col` argument specifies the colors of the lines.\n- The `xlab`, `ylab`, and `main` arguments set the labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and the main title of the plot, respectively.\n- Finally, the `legend()` function is used to add a legend to the plot, indicating the colors and labels of the lines.\n\n## Example 2 Using `lines()`:\nAnother way to plot multiple lines is to plot them one by one using the `points()` and `lines()` functions. Here's an example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create sample data\nx <- 1:10\ny1 <- c(1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 10, 2)\ny2 <- c(2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, 10, 3, 1)\ny3 <- c(3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9, 2, 4, 1)\n\n# Create an empty plot\nplot(x, y1, type = \"n\", xlim = c(1, 10), ylim = c(0, 10), \n     xlab = \"X\", ylab = \"Y\", main = \"Multiple Lines Plot\")\n\n# Plot each line one by one\nlines(x, y1, type = \"l\", col = \"red\")\nlines(x, y2, type = \"l\", col = \"blue\")\nlines(x, y3, type = \"l\", col = \"green\")\n\n# Add a legend\nlegend(\"topright\", legend = c(\"Line 1\", \"Line 2\", \"Line 3\"), \n       col = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"), lty = 1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Explanation\n\n- We create the same sample data as in the previous example.\n- The `plot()` function is used to create an empty plot with appropriate labels and limits.\n- We then use the `lines()` function to plot each line one by one. The `type = \"l\"` argument specifies that we want to plot lines, and the `col` argument sets the color of each line.\n- Finally, the `legend()` function is used to add a legend to the plot.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we explored two methods for plotting multiple lines on a graph using base R: `matplot()` and `lines()`. We provided step-by-step examples and explained the code in simple terms. We encourage you to try these methods on your own datasets and experiment with different customization options. By mastering these techniques, you will be able to create visually appealing and informative plots in R. Happy plotting!\n\n# References\n\n- https://www.statology.org/how-to-plot-multiple-lines-data-series-in-one-chart-in-r/\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14860078/plot-multiple-lines-data-series-each-with-unique-color-in-r\n- https://r-coder.com/line-graph-r/\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plot-multiple-lines-in-matplotlib/\n- http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/line-plots-r-base-graphs\n- http://www.countbio.com/web_pages/left_object/R_for_biology/R_fundamentals/multiple_curves_R.html",
