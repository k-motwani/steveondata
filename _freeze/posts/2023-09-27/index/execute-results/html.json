Sanderson II, MPH\"\ndate: \"2023-09-27\"\ncategories: [rtip, viz]\n---\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nData visualization is a crucial aspect of data analysis and exploration. It allows us to gain insights, spot trends, and communicate our findings effectively. In R, there are numerous packages and libraries available for creating sophisticated plots, but understanding the basics of base R plotting is essential for any data analyst or scientist.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll explore how to overlay points or lines on a plot using Base R. We'll use the `plot()` function to create the initial plot and then show how to overlay points with `points()` and lines with `lines()`. We'll provide several examples, explaining each code block in simple terms, and encourage you to try them out on your own datasets.\n\n# Setting Up the Environment\n\nBefore we start, make sure you have R installed on your system. You can download and install R from the official website (https://www.r-project.org/). Additionally, we'll assume you have a basic understanding of R syntax and data structures.\n\n# Examples\n\n## Example 1: Overlaying Points on a Scatter Plot\n\nLet's begin with a simple scatter plot. Suppose we have two vectors, `x` and `y`, representing data points.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample data\nx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ny <- c(2, 4, 1, 5, 7)\n\n# Create the initial scatter plot\nplot(x, y, main = \"Scatter Plot with Overlay Points\", xlab = \"X-axis\", ylab = \"Y-axis\")\n\n# Overlay additional points (red circles) on the plot\npoints(x, y, col = \"red\", pch = 16)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, we use the `plot()` function to create a scatter plot of `x` and `y`. Then, we overlay red circles on the existing plot using `points()`. The `col` argument specifies the color, and `pch` determines the point shape (16 represents circles).\n\n## Example 2: Overlaying Lines on a Line Plot\n\nNow, let's work with line plots. Suppose we have two vectors, `x` and `y`, representing data points for a line graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample data\nx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ny <- c(2, 4, 1, 5, 7)\n\n# Create the initial line plot\nplot(x, y, type = \"l\", main = \"Line Plot with Overlay Lines\", xlab = \"X-axis\", ylab = \"Y-axis\")\n\n# Overlay a new line (dashed, blue) on the plot\nlines(x, y + 1, col = \"blue\", lty = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, we use the `plot()` function with `type = \"l\"` to create a line plot. Then, we overlay a dashed blue line on the plot using `lines()`. The `col` argument sets the line color, and `lty` specifies the line type (2 stands for dashed).\n\n## Example 3: Combining Points and Lines\n\nIn some cases, you might want to overlay both points and lines on the same plot to illustrate relationships more clearly. Let's see how to do that:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample data\nx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\ny <- c(2, 4, 1, 5, 7)\n\n# Create the initial scatter plot\nplot(x, y, main = \"Scatter Plot with Overlay Points and Lines\", xlab = \"X-axis\", ylab = \"Y-axis\")\n\n# Overlay points (green triangles)\npoints(x, y, col = \"green\", pch = 17)\n\n# Overlay a line (purple) connecting the points\nlines(x, y, col = \"purple\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this example, we start with a scatter plot and overlay green triangles using `points()` and a purple line using `lines()`. The combination of points and lines can help emphasize patterns and relationships in your data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this blog post, we've explored how to overlay points and lines on a plot in Base R. We've covered scatter plots, line plots, and combinations of both. Overlaying points and lines can be a powerful way to enhance your data visualizations and convey insights effectively.\n\nNow it's your turn! Experiment with different datasets and customize your plots by adjusting colors, shapes, and line styles. Base R provides a solid foundation for data visualization, and mastering it will enable you to create informative plots for your data analysis projects.",
