Sanderson II, MPH\"\ndate: \"2022-11-10\"\ncategories: [code, rtip, purrr]\n---\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nThere may be times when you have multiple structured files in the same folder, maybe they are `.csv` files. For this short tip, we will say that they are.\n\nI will show the short script and then discuss it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Library Load ----\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\n# Set file path ----\nfolder    <- \"FileFolder\"\npath      <- \"C:/Some/Root/Path/\"\nfull_path <- paste0(path,folder,\"/\")\n\n# File List ----\nfile_list <- dir(full_path\n                 , pattern = \"\\\\.csv$\"\n                 , full.names = T)\n\n# Read Files ----\nfiles <- file_list %>%\n  map(read.csv) %>%\n  map(as_tibble)\n\n# Clean File Names ----\nfile_names <- file_list %>%\n  str_remove(full_path) %>%\n  str_replace(\n    pattern = \"_OldStuff.csv\", \n    replacement = \"_NewStuff.csv\"\n  )\n\nnames(files) <- file_names\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe load in `{dplyr}` for the pipe and the `as_tibble` function. After this we set out to create the file path. I have chosen to do this in two separate pieces as I have had experience with needing to go through different folders in the same root directory. While this could further be scripted I leave it as is.\n\n`folder` is the folder that has the files of interest, in this case the `.csv` files. We then get the root path to that folder but not including it, this is defined as `path` in the above. After we have both `folder` and `path` we can create the `full_path` by using `paste0`\n\nNow after this we use the base `R` function of `dir` to list out all of the files that fit the specific format of `.csv` with a `regex` pattern. I always want the name of the file as it allows me to go back to the file later and lets me name the files in the upcoming list later on.\n\nSince these are `.csv` files I use `purrr::map` and then `read.csv` to read in all of the `.csv` files in the list that was created, we then used `map` again and this time used `as_tibble` to make sure that each file is a `tibble` and not something else like `data.frame`\n\nSince I provided the argument of `T` to `dir, full.names` I can then get a character vector of the names of the files which then is applied to the file list.\n\nVoila!",
