Sanderson II, MPH\"\ndate: \"2022-11-14\"\ncategories: [code, rtip, healthyrai, skew]\n---\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nSometimes we may want to quickly find skewed features in a data set. This is easily achiveable using the `{healthyR.ai}` library. There is a simple function called [`hai_skewed_features()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ai/reference/hai_skewed_features.html). We are going to go over this function today.\n\n# Function\n\nLet's first take a look at the function call.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhai_skewed_features(\n  .data, \n  .threshold = 0.6, \n  .drop_keys = NULL\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's take a look at the arguments that go to the parameters of the function.\n\n*  `.data` - The data.frame/tibble you are passing in.\n*  `.threshold` - A level of skewness that indicates where you feel a column should be considered skewed.\n*  `.drop_keys` - A c() character vector of columns you do not want passed to the function.\n\n\n# Example\n\nHere are a couple of examples.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(healthyR.ai)\n\nhai_skewed_features(mtcars)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"mpg\"  \"hp\"   \"carb\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhai_skewed_features(mtcars, .drop_keys = \"hp\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"mpg\"  \"carb\"\n```\n:::\n:::",
