Sanderson II, MPH\"\ndate: \"2022-12-21\"\ncategories: [code, rtip, tidydensity]\n---\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nIf you're working with statistical distributions in R, you may be interested in the [`{TidyDensity}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/) package. This package provides a set of functions for creating, manipulating, and visualizing probability distributions in a tidy format. One of these functions is [`tidy_chisquare()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/reference/tidy_chisquare.html), which allows you to create a chi-square distribution with a specified number of degrees of freedom and a non-centrality parameter.\n\nOnce you've created a chi-square distribution using `tidy_chisquare()`, you may want to get some summary statistics about the distribution. This is where the [`util_chisquare_stats_tbl()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/reference/util_chisquare_stats_tbl.html) function comes in handy. This function takes a chi-square distribution (created with `tidy_chisquare()`) as input and returns a tibble with several statistics about the distribution.\n\nSome of the statistics included in the table are:\n\n*  Mean: The mean of the chi-square distribution, also known as the expected value.\n*  Variance: The variance of the chi-square distribution, which is a measure of how spread out the data is.\n*  Skewness: The skewness of the chi-square distribution, which is a measure of the symmetry of the data.\n*  Kurtosis: The kurtosis of the chi-square distribution, which is a measure of the peakedness of the data.\n\nTo use the `util_chisquare_stats_tbl()` function, you'll need to install and load the `{TidyDensity}` package first. Then, you can create a chi-square distribution using `tidy_chisquare()` and pass it to `util_chisquare_stats_tbl()` like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install and load TidyDensity\ninstall.packages(\"TidyDensity\")\nlibrary(TidyDensity)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# create a chi-square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom\ndistribution <- tidy_chisquare(.df = 5)\n\n# get statistics about the distribution\nutil_chisquare_stats_tbl(distribution) |>\n  glimpse()\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe output will be a table with the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the chi-square distribution. These statistics can be useful for understanding the characteristics of the distribution and making statistical inferences.\n\nOverall, the `{TidyDensity}` package is a useful tool for working with statistical distributions in R. The `util_chisquare_stats_tbl()` function is just one of many functions available in the package that can help you analyze and understand your data. Give it a try and see how it can help with your statistical analysis!\n\n# Function\n\nLet's take a look at the full function call.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nutil_chisquare_stats_tbl(.data)\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's take a look at the arguments that get supplied to the function parameters.\n\n*  `.data` - The data being passed from a tidy_ distribution function.\n\n# Example\n\nNow for a full example with output.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(TidyDensity)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ntidy_chisquare() %>%\n  util_chisquare_stats_tbl() %>%\n  glimpse()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 1\nColumns: 17\n$ tidy_function     <chr> \"tidy_chisquare\"\n$ function_call     <chr> \"Chisquare c(1, 1)\"\n$ distribution      <chr> \"Chisquare\"\n$ distribution_type <chr> \"continuous\"\n$ points            <dbl> 50\n$ simulations       <dbl> 1\n$ mean              <dbl> 1\n$ median            <dbl> 0.3333333\n$ mode              <chr> \"undefined\"\n$ std_dv            <dbl> 1.414214\n$ coeff_var         <dbl> 1.414214\n$ skewness          <dbl> 2.828427\n$ kurtosis          <dbl> 15\n$ computed_std_skew <dbl> 1.132669\n$ computed_std_kurt <dbl> 3.894553\n$ ci_lo             <dbl> 0.002189912\n$ ci_hi             <dbl> 6.521727\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVoila!",
