Sanderson II, MPH\"\ndate: \"2023-01-27\"\ncategories: [code, weeklytip, augment, healthyr]\n---\n\n\n# Introduction\n\nHealthcare data analysis can be a complex and time-consuming task, but it doesn't have to be. Meet [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/), your new go-to R package for all things healthcare data analysis. With [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/), you can easily and efficiently analyze your healthcare data, and make sense of the information it contains.\n\nOne of the key features of [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/) is the [service_line_augment()](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/reference/service_line_augment.html) function. This function is designed to help you quickly and easily append a vector to a `data.frame` or `tibble` that is passed to the `.data` parameter. In order to use this function, you will need a `data.frame` or `tibble` with a __principal diagnosis__ column, a __principal procedure__ column, and a column for the __DRG number__. These are needed so that the function can join the _dx_cc_mapping_ and _px_cc_mapping_ columns to provide the __service line__.\n\nThe [service_line_augment()](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/reference/service_line_augment.html) function is especially useful for analyzing healthcare data that is coded using ICD Version 10. This version of the ICD coding system is widely used in the healthcare industry, and the [service_line_augment()](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/reference/service_line_augment.html) function is specifically designed to work with it. With this function, you can quickly and easily append a vector to your data.frame or tibble that provides the service line for each visit.\n\nIn addition to the [service_line_augment()](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/reference/service_line_augment.html) function, [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/) also includes a wide range of other useful tools and functions for healthcare data analysis. Whether you're looking to analyze claims data, clinical data, or any other type of healthcare data, [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/) has you covered.\n\nSo why wait? Download [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/) today and start making sense of your healthcare data! With [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/), you can easily and efficiently analyze your healthcare data, and make sense of the information it contains.\n\n# Function\n\nLet's take a look at the full function call.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nservice_line_augment(.data, .dx_col, .px_col, .drg_col)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow let's look at the arguments to the parameters.\n\n*  `.data` - The data being passed that will be augmented by the function.\n*  `.dx_col` - The column containing the Principal Diagnosis for the discharge.\n*  `.px_col` - The column containing the Principal Coded Procedure for the discharge. It is possible that this could be blank.\n*  `.drg_col` - The DRG Number coded to the inpatient discharge.\n\nNow for some examples.\n\n# Example\n\nFirst if you have not already, install [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"healthyR\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere we go.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(healthyR)\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  dx_col = \"F10.10\",\n  px_col = NA,\n  drg_col = \"896\"\n)\n\nservice_line_augment(\n  .data = df,\n  .dx_col = dx_col,\n  .px_col = px_col,\n  .drg_col = drg_col\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 1 Ã— 4\n  dx_col px_col drg_col service_line \n  <chr>  <lgl>  <chr>   <chr>        \n1 F10.10 NA     896     alcohol_abuse\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVoila!",
