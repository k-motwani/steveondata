# Introduction

There are two components to time-series clustering with `{healthyR.ts}`. There is the function that will create the clustering data along with a slew of other information and then there is a plotting function that will plot out the data in a time-series fashion colored by cluster.

The first function as mentioned is the function `ts_feature_cluster()`, and the next is `ts_feature_cluster_plot()`

Function Reference:

-   [`ts_feature_cluster()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/reference/ts_feature_cluster.html)
-   [ts_feature_cluster_plot()\`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/reference/ts_feature_cluster_plot.html)

We are going to use the built-in `AirPassengers` data set for this example so let's get right to it!

# Library Load

```{r library_load}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(healthyR.ts))
```

# Data

Now that our libraries are loaded we can go ahead and get the data and run it through the function.

```{r data_load}
data_tbl <- ts_to_tbl(AirPassengers) %>%
  select(-index) %>%
  mutate(group_id = rep(1:12, 12))

output <- ts_feature_cluster(
  .data = data_tbl,
  .date_col = date_col,
  .value_col = value,
  group_id,
  .features = c("acf_features","entropy"),
  .scale = TRUE,
  .prefix = "ts_",
  .centers = 3
)
```

Now that we have our data and our output, lets first take a look at our data so we can see what we passed to it.

```{r glimpse_data}
glimpse(data_tbl)
```

Now as mentioned, the output list contains many items. There are both data items and plot items.

First though, you will notice in the `ts_feature_cluster()` function that there is a parameter called `.features`, this allows you to pass in a list of quoted functions to apply to the time-series. This means that you can create a function your self in the `.GlobalEnviron` and pass that as a quoted argument to this parameter.

For example you could create your own function called `my_mean`. Let's see how this would work.

`my_mean <- function(x) ret <- mean(x, na.rm = TRUE) return(ret)`

You can then call this by using `.features = c("my_mean")`.

Pretty simple!

Under the hood this function itself makes use of `timetk::tk_tsfeatures()` which is a `tidyverse` compliant wrapper to `tsfeatures::tsfeatures()`

Here are the links to those functions:

-   [`tk_tsfeatures()`](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/reference/tk_tsfeatures.html)
-   [`tsfeatures()`](http://pkg.robjhyndman.com/tsfeatures/reference/tsfeatures.html)

Now let's take a look at the output

# Function Output

## ts_feature_cluster()

As mentioned there are several outputs from the `ts_feature_cluster()`. Those are as follows:

*Data Section*

-   ts_feature_tbl
-   user_item_matrix_tbl
-   mapped_tbl
-   scree_data_tbl
-   input_data_tbl (the original data)

*Plots*

-   static_plot
-   plotly_plot

Now that we have our output, let's take a look at each individual component of the output.

**ts_feature_tbl**

```{r out1}
output$data$ts_feature_tbl |> glimpse()
```

**user_item_matrix_tbl**

```{r out2}
output$data$user_item_matrix_tbl |> glimpse()
```

**mapped_tbl**

```{r out3}
output$data$mapped_tbl |> glimpse()
```

**scree_data_tbl**

```{r out4}
output$data$scree_data_tbl |> glimpse()
```

**input_data_tbl**

```{r out5}
output$data$input_data_tbl |> glimpse()
```

Now the plots.

**static_plot**

```{r out6}
output$plots$static_plot
```

**plotly_plot**

```{r out7}
output$plots$plotly_plot
```

Now that we have seen the output of the `ts_feature_cluster()` function, let's take a look at the output of the `ts_feature_cluster_plot()` function.

## ts_feature_cluster_plot()

This function itself returns a list object of a multitude of data. First before we get into that lets look at the function call itself:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ts_feature_cluster_plot(
  .data,
  .date_col,
  .value_col,
  ...,
  .center = 3,
  .facet_ncol = 3,
  .smooth = FALSE
)
```

The data that comes back from this function is:

*Data Section*

-   original_data
-   kmm_data_tbl
-   user_item_tbl
-   cluster_tbl

*Plots*

-   static_plot
-   plotly_plot

*K-Means Object*

-   k-means object

We will go through the same exercise and show the output of all the sections. First we have to create the output. The static plot will automatically print out.

```{r cluster_plot}
plot_out <- ts_feature_cluster_plot(
  .data = output,
  .date_col = date_col,
  .value_col = value,
  .center = 2,
  group_id
)
```

### The Data Section:

**original_data**

```{r}
plot_out$data$original_data |> glimpse()
```

**kmm_data_tbl**

```{r}
plot_out$data$kmm_data_tbl |> glimpse()
```

**user_item_data**

```{r}
plot_out$data$user_item_data |> glimpse()
```

**cluster_tbl**

```{r}
plot_out$data$cluster_tbl |> glimpse()
```

### The plot data.

**static_plot**

```{r}
plot_out$plot$static_plot
```

**plotly_plot**

```{r}
plot_out$plot$plotly_plot
```

### The K-Means Object

**kmeans_object**

```{r}
plot_out$kmeans_object
```

Thanks for reading!
