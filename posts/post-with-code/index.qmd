This is a simple `lapply` example to start things off.

```{r}
# Let l be some list of lists, where all elements of lists are numbers
l <- list(
  a = 1:10,
  b = 11:20,
  c = 21:30
)

```

Now let's take a look at our list `l` and see it's structure.

```{r}
l
```

Now that we see the structure, we can use the `lapply` function to get the sum of each list element, the mean, etc.

```{r}
lapply(l, sum)
lapply(l, mean)
```

Voila!
