# Introducton

This is going to be a simple example on how we can make a function in #base #r that will crate a cumulative variance function. From base R we are going to use `seq_along()`, `stats::var()`, and `sapply()` inside of the function we will call `cvar` for *cumulative variance*.

# Generate Data

The first thing we need to do in order to showcase this function is to generate some data. Lets do that below:

```{r gen_data}
l <- list(
  a = rnorm(50),
  b = rnorm(50, 1),
  c = rnorm(50, 2)
)

l
```

# Make Function

Now that we have our data, lets make the function:

```{r fns}
cvar <- function(.x){
  sapply(seq_along(.x), function(k, z) stats::var(z[1:k]), z = .x)
}
```

Ok, now that we have our function, lets take a look at it in use.

# Use Function

```{r use_fns}
sapply(l, cvar)

lapply(l, cvar)
```

Voila!
