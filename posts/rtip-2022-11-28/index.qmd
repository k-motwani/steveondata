# Introduction

When modeling it is always good to understand your model performance against some metric The `{tidymodels}` `package` `{yardstick}` is a great resource for this.


In my _R package_ `{healthyR.ai}` there are two functions that allow you to either __minimize__ or __maximize__ some cost function against your modeling problem.

These functions are:
*  `hai_default_regression_metric_set()`
*  `hai_default_classification_metric_set()`

# Function

The functions themselves are `{yardstick}` metric set functions. Let's take a look at them.

```{r fns, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(healthyR.ai)

hai_default_classification_metric_set()

hai_default_regression_metric_set()
```

Voila!
