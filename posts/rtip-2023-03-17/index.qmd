I am thrilled to announce that the R universe of packages [`{healthyverse}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyverse/) has surpassed 60,000 downloads! Thank you to everyone who has downloaded and used these packages, your support is greatly appreciated.

For those who are not familiar, the {healthyverse} package is a collection of R packages focused on data science and analysis with an emphasis on healthcare. These packages are ever evolving and for the most part still in an experimental stage, but are maturing. These packages are:

*  [`{healthyR}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR/)
*  [`{healthyR.ts}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/)
*  [`{healthyR.ai}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ai/)
*  [`{healthyR.data}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.data/)
*  [`{TidyDensity}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/)
*  [`{tidyAML}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/tidyAML/)


I am continuously working on updates and improvements to the {healthyverse} package, and I hope to release them soon. Some of the updates include bug fixes, new functionality, and enhancements to existing functions.

Additionally, I want to encourage users who are interested in contributing to the {healthyverse} package to submit pull requests. Contributions can be in the form of bug fixes, new functions, or enhancements to existing ones. I am always open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve these packages.

Once again, thank you to everyone who has downloaded and used the {healthyverse} package. Your support motivates me to continue working on this project and making it the best it can be.
