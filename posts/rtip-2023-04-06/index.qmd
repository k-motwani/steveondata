# Introduction

This R package provides a user-friendly interface for accessing data from the [`{BRVM}`](https://github.com/Koffi-Fredysessie/BRVM), which is a regional stock exchange serving multiple West African countries. With this package, users can easily retrieve historical stock price data, trading volumes, and other financial indicators for a variety of stocks traded on the BRVM.

The package is designed to simplify the process of gathering and analyzing financial data, making it easier for researchers, investors, and other users to extract insights and make informed decisions based on the information available. Overall, BRVM library is a valuable tool for anyone looking to gain a better understanding of the BRVM and the financial markets in West Africa.

For now, you can install from __GitHub__ until it is on CRAN (It is on the way)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# github dev version
## We can use devtools
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Koffi-Fredysessie/BRVM")

# Or use remotes
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Koffi-Fredysessie/BRVM")
```

# Examples

First, let's load in the _BRVM_ package:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(BRVM)
```

## The **BRVM_ticker_desc()** function
 
It receives no argument and returns BRVM tickers information such as its full name, sector and country.

```{r BRVM_ticker_desc, eval=FALSE}
# Display tickers of BRVM
tickers <- BRVM_ticker_desc()
tickers
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
kable(BRVM_ticker_desc(), "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```


## The **BRVM_index()** function :
It receives no argument and returns a table of updated data (with as table header: indexes, previous closing, closing, change (%), Year to Date Change) on all the indices available on the BRVM exchange.

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(BRVM_index() , "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

## The **BRVM_get(".symbol", ".from", ".to")** function
 
This function will get the data of the companies listed on the BVRM stock exchange in Rich Bourse website. The function takes a single parameter, `.symbol` (which represents the "Ticker").
The function will automatically format tickers you enter in uppercase using toupper() and then ensure that the passed ticker is in a Google spreadsheet of allowed tickers.

* .symbol : A vector of symbols, like: c("BICC","XOM","SlbC") ;
* .from : A quoted start date, ie. "2020-01-01" or "2020/01/01". The date must be in ymd format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY/MM/DD" ;
* .to : A quoted end date, ie. "2022-01-31" or "2022/01/31". The date must be in ymd format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY/MM/DD".

```{r BRVM_get}
#' Displaying data of SONATEL Senegal stock
BRVM_get(.symbol = "snts")
symbols <- c("BiCc","XOM","SlbC")   # We use here three tickers
data_tbl <- BRVM_get(.symbol = symbols, .from = "2020-01-01", .to = Sys.Date() - 1)
# Display the first twenty observations of the table
head(data_tbl, 20)
# Display the last twenty elements of the table
tail(data_tbl, 20)
```

## The **BRVM_get1("ticker ", "Period", "from", "to")** function

This function will get data of the companies listed on the BVRM stock exchange through the sikafinance site.
The function takes in a single parameter of ticker and will auto-format the tickers you input into all upper case by using `toupper()`

* ticker : A vector of ticker, like: c("BICC","XOM","SlbC", "BRvm10");
* Period : Numeric number indicating time period. Valid entries are 0, 1, 5, 30, 91, and 365 representing respectively 'daily', 'one year', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'quarterly' and 'yearly';
* from : A quoted start date, ie. "2020-01-01" or "2020/01/01". The date must be in ymd format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY/MM/DD";
* to : A quoted end date, ie. "2022-01-31" or "2022/01/31". The date must be in ymd format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY/MM/DD"

** NB : There is a small difference between the BRVM_get and BRVM_get1 functions.
* With BRVM_get it is only possible to download tickers' daily data.
* But with BRVM_get1, you can download daily, weekly, monthly, annual tickers’ data, indices and even market capitalization.

```{r BRVM_get1}
#' Displaying data of SONATEL Senegal stock
BRVM_get1("snts")
# Get daily data of all indexes
all_ind <- BRVM_get1("ALL INDEXES", Period = 0, from = "2020-01-04", to = "2023-03-24") 
# display the first two tens elements of the table
head(all_ind, 20)
# display the two tens of the last elements of the table
tail(all_ind, 20)
# To get yearly data
yearly_data <- BRVM_get1(c("brvmtr", "BiCc", "BOAS"), Period = 365 ) 
# display the first two tens elements of the table
head(yearly_data, 20) 
# display the two tens of the last elements of the table
tail(yearly_data, 20) 
``` 

## The **BRVM.index()** function :
It receives no argument and returns the name of all indexes available on BRVM Stock Exchange.

```{r BRVM.index}
BRVM.index()
```
