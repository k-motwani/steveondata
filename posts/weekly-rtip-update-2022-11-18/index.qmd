# Introduction

I have made several updates to [`{healthyverse}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyverse/), this has resulted in new releases to CRAN for [`{healthyR.ai}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ai/), [`{healthyR.ts}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/), and [`{TidyDesnsity}`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/).

# Some New Functions

Let's take a look at some new functions.

## TidyDensity

For TidyDensity a new distribution was added, welcome [`tidy_bernoulli()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/reference/tidy_bernoulli.html?q=ber#null). This distribution also comes with the standard [`util_distname_param_estimate()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/reference/util_bernoulli_param_estimate.html) and the [`util_distname_stats_tbl()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/TidyDensity/reference/util_bernoulli_stats_tbl.html) functions. Let's take a look at the function calls.

```{r fns, eval=FALSE}
tidy_bernoulli(.n = 50, .prob = 0.1, .num_sims = 1)

util_bernoulli_param_estimate(.x, .auto_gen_empirical = TRUE)

util_bernoulli_stats_tbl(.data)
```

Let's see them in use.

```{r tidydensity_example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(TidyDensity)
library(dplyr)

tb <- tidy_bernoulli()

tb

util_bernoulli_param_estimate(tb$y)

util_bernoulli_stats_tbl(tb) %>%
  glimpse()
```

## healthyR.ai

This was a minor patch release that exported some previously internal only functions and fixed an error with the custom recipe steps. One of the functions that has been exported is [`hai_data_impute()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ai/reference/hai_data_impute.html?q=hai_data#null)

Let's take a look.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
hai_data_impute(
  .recipe_object = NULL,
  ...,
  .seed_value = 123,
  .type_of_imputation = "mean",
  .number_of_trees = 25,
  .neighbors = 5,
  .mean_trim = 0,
  .roll_statistic,
  .roll_window = 5
)
```

Let's take a look at an example of it's use.

```{r healthyr_ai_example, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(recipes)
library(healthyR.ai)

date_seq <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2013-01-01"), length.out = 100, by = "month")
val_seq <- rep(c(rnorm(9), NA), times = 10)
df_tbl <- tibble(
  date_col = date_seq,
  value    = val_seq
)

df_tbl

rec_obj <- recipe(value ~ ., df_tbl)

hai_data_impute(
  .recipe_object = rec_obj,
  value,
  .type_of_imputation = "roll",
  .roll_statistic = median
)$impute_rec_obj %>%
  get_juiced_data()
```

## healthyR.ts

This was a minor patch release fixing the function [`ts_lag_correlation()`](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR.ts/reference/ts_lag_correlation.html) when the column that was the value was not explicitly called...`value`.

Thank you!
